# üß† Deep Learning Segmentation Pipeline for the Spires-Jones Lab

This pipeline provides a deep learning-based alternative to the traditional thresholding approach used in the Spires-Jones lab.  
It supports both the **Cellpose CNN model** and the **SAM2 Transformer model** for image segmentation.

The system allows users to either retrain models or load pretrained ones via a command-line interface.  
This design enables flexible model usage without modifying the core Python code.  
Segmentation behavior can be adjusted through mode selection and parameter tuning, depending on the object type.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
- Compatible with Cellpose and SAM2 segmentation models  
- Flexible run modes: `tune`, `train`, `evaluate`  
- Command-line interface for full pipeline control  
- Output includes logs, performance metrics, visualizations, and trained models
